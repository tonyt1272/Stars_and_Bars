# Stars_and_Bars

# This python3 file gives a visual representation of the "Stars and Bars" method for finding the number of ways to write
# a number (n) as the sum of (k) non-negative integers, when order matters.  It is a literal implementation of the
# algorithm and so does NOT calculate values using the binomial coefficient at ( n + k -1 )
#                                                                              (   k-1    )
# but derives values directly from the implementation of the algorithm.  This method is slow and presented here for
# visual purposes only.
